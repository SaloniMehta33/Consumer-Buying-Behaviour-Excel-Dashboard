## Consumer Insights

### 1. Clothing Is the Primary Growth Driver
Clothing contributes **45% of total purchases**, making it the dominant category. This high share is strongly influenced by consumers in the **28–37 age group**, indicating that working professionals drive apparel consumption.

### 2. Age Group Drives Multi-Category Consumption
The **28–37 age bracket** shows the highest purchasing activity across both **Clothing and Accessories**, suggesting lifestyle-driven consumption where accessories often complement apparel purchases.

### 3. Male Consumers Show Higher Purchase Contribution
Male consumers dominate overall purchases, particularly in the Clothing category. The item mix and purchase behaviour indicate a strong **gifting influence**, supported by higher purchases of dresses, shirts, jewellery, and sunglasses.

### 4. Item-Level Insights Reflect Utility and Gifting Mix
- **Top Clothing Items:** Blouse, Dress, Shirt  
- **Top Accessories:** Belt, Jewellery, Sunglasses  

This combination highlights a balance between **everyday essentials** and **occasion-based or emotional purchases**.

### 5. Low Dependency on Promotions
Despite a thin margin difference of **5–10%**, consumers tend to buy more during **non-promotional periods**. This suggests:
- Low price sensitivity among core consumers  
- Strong need-based or brand-driven purchase decisions  

### 6. Predictable Purchase Cycles Enable Planning
Clothing purchases commonly follow a **monthly or quarterly (3-month)** cycle, indicating planned repeat consumption and opportunities for demand forecasting and campaign alignment.

## Business Implications
- Focus marketing and assortment strategies on the **28–37 age segment**
- Leverage gifting-driven demand through targeted campaigns for male consumers
- Optimize promotions selectively, as discounts are not the primary purchase trigger
- Align new launches and campaigns with monthly and quarterly buying cycles
